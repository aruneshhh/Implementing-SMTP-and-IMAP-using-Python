# Implementing SMTP and IMAP using Python

This project demonstrates how to use Python to work with email protocolsâ€”**SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** for sending emails and **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** for retrieving and managing emails. It is an educational project designed to explore programmatic email handling with Python.

## Features

- **Send Emails**:
  - Use the `smtplib` library to send emails programmatically.
  - Supports plain text and HTML content.

- **Receive and Manage Emails**:
  - Use the `imaplib` library to fetch, read, and delete emails from your inbox.
  - Handle various email formats and attachments.

- **Email Automation**:
  - Automate email-related tasks like status notifications or periodic updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `smtplib` for sending emails.
  - `imaplib` for retrieving and managing emails.
  - `email` for constructing and parsing email messages.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Access to an email account (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) with SMTP and IMAP enabled.
- Basic understanding of email protocols.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aruneshhh/Implementing-SMTP-and-IMAP-using-Python.git
   cd Implementing-SMTP-and-IMAP-using-Python
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure `smtplib` and `imaplib` are available as they are part of Python's standard library. If additional libraries are needed, install them using `pip`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and include the following:
   ```env
   EMAIL_ADDRESS=<Your email address>
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=<Your email password>
   ```

4. **Run the Examples**:
   Execute the scripts to test sending and receiving emails:
   ```bash
   python send_email.py
   python receive_email.py
   ```

## Usage

### Sending Emails
Customize `send_email.py` to specify:
- Recipients
- Subject
- Message body (plain text or HTML)

Example:
```python
server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
```

### Receiving Emails
Modify `receive_email.py` to filter emails based on:
- Sender
- Date
- Subject keywords

Example:
```python
mail.select("inbox")  # Access the inbox
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your email service allows access from less secure apps, or configure OAuth for secure access.
- Avoid sharing your credentials publicly; use environment variables or secure credential storage.
